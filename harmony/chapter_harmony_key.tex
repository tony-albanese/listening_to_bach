\chapter{Harmony and Key}
This is the dreaded music theory part of the talk. Please do not let the this topic discourage you. You do not need to be a musicologist (I'm not) to appreciate harmony and key. The labels that musicologists use to analyze a piece of music or to classify chords are good for their purposes. For us, our ears are sufficiently intelligent to perceive key and harmony in such a way as to make the music thoroughly excited. With a little guidance you can enhance your ears' innate ability to perceive key and harmony.

Key and harmony go hand-in-hand but they are not the same.
