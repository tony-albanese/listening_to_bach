\chapter{Chorales and Counterpoint}
There is simply no getting around the fact that Bach was a devout Lutheran and that his unshakable faith in God permeated every sheet of his music. As a result, a large number of his works are religious in nature and were meant to serve as part of religious services. Having said that, I want you to understand that regardless of your religious views, there is something for everyone in these works. They can be enjoyed on a purely musical level. 

There is one particular piece of religious music called a chorale. A chorale is Lutheran hymn that is set to music. These originated with Martin Luther when he began to translate religious songs into his native German. Chorales melodies tend to be simple, direct and harmonized - accompanied by - the typical SATB. Let us listen to one of my favorites, "Was Gott tut dass ist wohlgetan". We'll here the tune first in its bare bones form and then hear it as Bach harmonized it.

%example - Was Gott tut ist wohlgetan.

Do you hear how Bach's harmonization gives shape to the melody and makes it so rich? There is more, though. Bach wrote many such harmonizations and we will indeed spend quite a bit of time talking about harmony. 

But there is more, much more. Bach, more than any other composer, perfected and elevated the art of counterpoint. %Meaning of the word.
Counterpoint is art of combining two or more independent melodies so that they work together when played simultaneously. The idea behind good counterpoint is that all the lines of music are equally intersting. You don't necessarily have a clear meoldy and accompaniemnent. This is NOT how most music is today. Mot music we are accustomed to has a melody on top and an accompaniment. %Example
So when you hear Bach, your ear will smoosh everything together because that is what it has been doing. However, with practice, you can train your ear to hear each line of music both separately and together. You will hear much more.
